# kape-at-scale
Repo for code, techniques, ideas and questions about implementing KAPE at Scale.

The repo will be updated in the mid to last part of September 2019.  Hopefully information will be added as I have time and not all at once.

The issues section for this repo are open.  You can post questions, comments and your own ideas there.

Thanks for visting this page and watching the Webcast on Kape at Scale.  Life has gotten in the way of my updates of this page  but I hope add some good material for you all soon.

I the mean time here is an article by freind and SANS Instructor Carlos Cajigas that demos some of techniques that I discussed in the Webcast.  Enjoy!
