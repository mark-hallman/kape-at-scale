# kape-at-scale
Repo for code, techniques, ideas and questions about implementing KAPE at Scale.

The repo will be updated in the mid to last part of September 2019.  Hopefully information will be added as I have time and not all at once.

The issues section for this repo are open.  You can post questions, comments and your own ideas there.
